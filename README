Dependencies:
    libglfw.so    3.3.2

This project uses clang and the ninja buildsystem.

Building:
    1. ./mkdep to download, build, and install glfw3 into ./ext
    2. ./runex to build and launch ./bin/demos
       - This will build ./bin/libtxtquad.so as a side effect
       - Alternatively,
         running "ninja" in the root dir
         will build the .so by itself

Notes:
    - glfw is compiled statically into the binary by default
    - There is one example executable, but four demos.
      The demo selection can be controlled at compilation time by a define,
      or the $demo var in ./build.ninja
