Dependencies:
    libglfw.so    3.3.2

This project uses clang and the ninja buildsystem.

Building:
    1. ./mkdep to download, build, and install glfw3 into ./ext
    2. ./runex to build and launch ./bin/demos
       - This will build ./bin/libtxtquad.so as a side effect
       - Alternatively,
         running "ninja" in the root dir
         will build the .so by itself

Notes:
    - glfw is compiled statically into the binary by default
    - There is one example executable, but four demos.
      The demo selection can be controlled at compilation time by a define,
      or the $demo var in ./build.ninja

Using the input module:
    - Include inp.h in your application's source
    - When compiling txtquad,
      define INP_KEYS for keyboard + mouse press/hold/release polling macros,
      INP_TEXT for a text entry callback,
      and/or INP_MOUSE for a mouse position callback
    - You will also need the glfw header as a dev dependency
    - See ./inp.h and ./examples for API usage
